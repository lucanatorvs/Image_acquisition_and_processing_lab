\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This lab report documents our results from the lab assignments as part of Image Acquisition and Processing, which is a subject from the minor Embedded Systems 2022.

The original introduction of the study manual\cite{Lab_Assignments}states: \\

The students will work in groups of two and have to attend all lab-sessions in order to pass the course.
During the lab-sessions, the students are asked to take images and write software to process them.
Students are asked to bring their own laptops with an USB3.0 port. All assignments can be worked out on school-computers with the cameras supplied, but working independently on your own laptop is recommended. Students will receive a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with all software preinstalled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. \\

This report describes the exercises and how we attempted to solve them.

We used the virtual machine and project template provided by our teacher. However the code for assignment 4 to 6 was developed locally on a Debian "Buster" machine with the aid of Makefile's and the packaged Debian version of OpenCV2.
